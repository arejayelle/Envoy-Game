 // Sorry i'm a controller kid. not sure what are good keys

 ## Reading the code
 Oof. Sorry. Switched architectures throughout the project. 
 There are a few dead code files from when I tried some stuff that didn't turn out.
 Mostly referenced Brackeys 

 ## compilation
 I'm just realizing I did this is 2020.3.19 which is not the version on the lab computers so guess that sucks, eh?

## Note
I did all the sprites & animation myself :) first time doing pixel art
(I am also aware that the pixel art looks really bad blown up. I uhhh I tried.)
